# Beyond Profit: A Holistic View of Corporate Performance and Resilience during the COVID-19 Crisis through ESG Investing

## 1. Introduction

The share of firms disclosing non-financial information has grown dramatically, rising from 35% in 2010 to 86% in 2021[^1^]. Research indicates that companies that implement Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance Practices (ESGP) tend to outperform those that don't[^2^][^3^][^4^]. Despite mixed findings[^5^][^6^], ESGP has gained relevance during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, serving as a key factor in investment decisions[^7^].

The pandemic had profound economic implications, including corporate bankruptcies, job losses, and impacts on stock markets[^8^][^9^][^10^]. This crisis notably worsened compared to previous events like the Great Depression and the 2007/2008 financial crisis[^11^].

Prior research has highlighted the positive effects of ESGP on resilience and risk avoidance during crises[^12^][^13^][^14^]. This study aims to examine the influence of ESGP on Financial Performance Indicators (FINP) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. It seeks to leverage machine learning techniques to better understand this relationship.

## 2. Literature Review, Theoretical Framework, and Hypotheses

### 2.1. From ESGP toward FINP: Stakeholder Theory

According to stakeholder theory, a firmâ€™s responsibility extends beyond shareholders to a broader set of stakeholders[^15^][^16^]. This theory holds importance in the ESGP literature, offering both normative and economic arguments for implementing ESGP[^17^][^18^].

Numerous studies show that ESGP contributes to reduced corporate risks, lower cost of capital, decreased bankruptcy likelihood, enhanced competitive advantage, and improved FINP[^19^][^20^][^21^]. However, these findings are subject to variables such as methodology, measures used, and geographical settings[^22^].

ESGP's effectiveness depends on its components: Environmental responsibility boosts corporate reputation and value[^23^][^24^], social responsibility strengthens stakeholder relationships[^25^][^26^], and robust corporate governance promotes long-term growth and investment efficiency[^27^].
