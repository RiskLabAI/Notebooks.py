# Beyond Profit: A Holistic View of Corporate Performance and Resilience during the COVID-19 Crisis through ESG Investing

## 1. Introduction

The share of firms disclosing non-financial information has grown dramatically, rising from 35% in 2010 to 86% in 2021[^1^]. Research indicates that companies that implement Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance Practices (ESGP) tend to outperform those that don't[^2^][^3^][^4^]. Despite mixed findings[^5^][^6^], ESGP has gained relevance during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, serving as a key factor in investment decisions[^7^].

The pandemic had profound economic implications, including corporate bankruptcies, job losses, and impacts on stock markets[^8^][^9^][^10^]. This crisis notably worsened compared to previous events like the Great Depression and the 2007/2008 financial crisis[^11^].

Prior research has highlighted the positive effects of ESGP on resilience and risk avoidance during crises[^12^][^13^][^14^]. This study aims to examine the influence of ESGP on Financial Performance Indicators (FINP) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. It seeks to leverage machine learning techniques to better understand this relationship.

## 2. Literature Review, Theoretical Framework, and Hypotheses

### 2.1. From ESGP toward FINP: Stakeholder Theory

According to stakeholder theory, a firm’s responsibility extends beyond shareholders to a broader set of stakeholders[^15^][^16^]. This theory holds importance in the ESGP literature, offering both normative and economic arguments for implementing ESGP[^17^][^18^].

Numerous studies show that ESGP contributes to reduced corporate risks, lower cost of capital, decreased bankruptcy likelihood, enhanced competitive advantage, and improved FINP[^19^][^20^][^21^]. However, these findings are subject to variables such as methodology, measures used, and geographical settings[^22^].

ESGP's effectiveness depends on its components: Environmental responsibility boosts corporate reputation and value[^23^][^24^], social responsibility strengthens stakeholder relationships[^25^][^26^], and robust corporate governance promotes long-term growth and investment efficiency[^27^].

## 2.3 Twitter Sentiment as a Moderator

### Introduction

The role of media in influencing asset prices has long been established in academic literature (Chen et al., 2014; Li et al., 2017). Twitter, as a form of social media, has been highlighted as a significant platform for shaping both corporate decisions and stakeholder sentiments (Akyildirim et al., 2022; Corbet et al., 2022; Sprenger et al., 2014). This section explores Twitter's moderating effect on the relationship between Environmental, Social, and Governance Performance (ESGP) and Financial Performance (FINP).

### The Impact of Media and Twitter on ESGP

The media can not only shape public perception but also drive corporate policies for stakeholder approval (D. Liu & Jin, 2023; Yong et al., 2021; Azizul Islam, 2017). Specifically, Twitter stands out as a real-time, high-volume data source, making it invaluable for studying the impact of media attention on ESGP topics (Vargas et al., 2021; Kouloukoui et al., 2023).

### Twitter and Market Outcomes

Emotional content on Twitter has been linked to stock market performance (Bollen et al., 2011; Smailović et al., 2014). However, there are conflicting views on the extent of Twitter's impact on financial markets (Guijarro et al., 2019; Rakowski et al., 2021).

#### Hypothesis

Hypothesis 3: Twitter sentiment moderates the relationship between ESGP and FINP, both *before* (H3a) and *after* (H3b) the Covid-19 pandemic.

## 3. Research Methodology

### 3.1 Measurements of Variables

#### 3.1.1 Dependent Variable: ESGP

The Environmental, Social, and Governance Performance (ESGP) serves as the dependent variable, measured using Bloomberg's ESG score (Giannarakis, 2013). These scores range from 0.1 (minimal disclosure) to 100 (complete disclosure).

#### 3.1.2 Independent Variable: FINP

Financial Performance (FINP) is assessed through lagged variables like Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE), and Tobin's Q, correlated with ESGP scores from the subsequent year (2014-2023).

#### 3.1.3 Moderator Variable: Twitter Sentiment

Twitter sentiment acts as the moderating variable, based on the volume and emotional content of tweets related to ESGP topics.

#### 3.1.4 Control Variables

Control variables include:

- Systematic Risk (BETA): Measured using the beta factor (Chebbi et al., 2021).
- Firm Size (SIZE): Calculated as the natural logarithm of total assets (Chebbi et al., 2021).
- Industry Classification (IND): Represented by a four-digit numeric standard industrial classification code, with a dummy variable for manufacturing and services sectors (Bloomberg database).

These control variables align with those used in previous studies (Choi & Wang, 2009; Fischer & Sawczyn, 2013; Dunham & Garcia, 2021; Waddock & Graves, 1997).
