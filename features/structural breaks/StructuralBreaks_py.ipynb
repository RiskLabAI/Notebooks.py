    "# ⭐ Tutorial: Structural Break Detection (ADF) with RiskLabAI\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a tutorial for the structural break detection methods in the `RiskLabAI` library, based on Chapter 17 of 'Advances in Financial Machine Learning' by Marcos López de Prado.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to detect explosive behavior (bubbles) in a time series. We will use the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, but applied in two different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will demonstrate:\n",
    "1.  **Data Preparation:** Load and plot log-prices for Bitcoin (`BTC-USD`) to get a clear example of bubbles.\n",
    "2.  **Expanding Window ADF:** Use the `get_expanding_window_adf` function to see how the ADF statistic evolves over time. This helps visually identify when the series enters an explosive (bubble) regime.\n",
    "3.  **Backward Supremum ADF (BSADF):** Use the `get_bsadf_statistic` function to get a single test statistic for the *origination* of a bubble.\n",
    "4.  **Conclusion:** Compare the results."

    "1.  **`get_expanding_window_adf`:** This function is excellent for visualization. It generates a time series of the ADF statistic, allowing us to see *when* the market entered and exited a bubble-like state.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **`get_bsadf_statistic`:** This function is used for formal hypothesis testing. It returns the single highest ADF statistic (the supremum) from all possible windows, which can be compared against pre-computed critical values to determine if a bubble occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these functions provide a robust toolkit for detecting structural breaks."
