    "# ⭐ Tutorial: Microstructural Features with RiskLabAI\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a tutorial for the microstructural feature estimators in the `RiskLabAI` library, based on Chapter 19 of 'Advances in Financial Machine Learning' by Marcos López de Prado.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features are considered \"first-generation\" methods as they are derived directly from price data (High, Low, Close) to estimate market properties like illiquidity and volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will demonstrate:\n",
    "1.  **Data Preparation:** Load daily High, Low, and Close (HLC) data for SPY.\n",
    "2.  **Corwin-Schultz Spread:** Use `corwin_schultz_estimator` to estimate the bid-ask spread, a measure of market liquidity.\n",
    "3.  **Bekker-Parkinson Volatility:** Use `bekker_parkinson_volatility_estimates` to estimate volatility, which adjusts for the spread.\n",
    "4.  **Visualization:** Plot the price, the estimated spread, and the estimated volatility to see how they relate.\n",
    "5.  **Conclusion:** Summarize the applications of these estimators."
