    "1.  **Variation of Information (VI):** Calculate VI using both a naive and an optimal number of bins.\n",
    "2.  **Correlation vs. Mutual Information:** We'll run three tests to show a critical weakness of correlation.\n",

    "    * Case 2: Linear Relationship\n",
    "    * Case 3: Non-Linear Relationship\n",
    "3.  **Conclusion:** We'll show why Mutual Information (MI) is a superior metric for detecting non-linear patterns in financial data."
